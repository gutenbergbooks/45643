<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Winding</span> down the street in wearied gaiety, the barrel-organ dribbled out its song</p>
<p class="i4">Merged with the thud of feet forever dallying indifferent and indefinite along.</p>
<p class="i0">The houses stood like rows of cripples, some paralysed, some hunch-backed and some bent with age,</p>
<p class="i0">They seemed at war, their chimneys threatening, their brows hung heavy in a sombre rage.</p>
<p class="i0">Crab-like the children crawled, while always hammering above their heads the scolding shrewish tongue;</p>
<p class="i0">They grew as bloodless flowers unflourishing, waxen and pale from out the dust and dung.</p>
<p class="i0">Above I saw the strip of sunset fluttering, even as washed-out rags upon the line,</p>
<p class="i0">I listened to the sparrows twittering, and the hours ticking in a slow decline.</p>
<p class="i0">Then beaded on the hem of evening, the coloured lights were threaded here and there,</p>
<p class="i0">Till proud with sweets and plumes and oranges, the shops grew brilliant in the tinsel glare.</p>
<p class="i0">Grey was the death-bed of the twilight, shuddering the faint hands of the day stretched to the night,</p>
<p class="i0">Fending it off, or feebly wavering over the pallid glints of stolen light.</p>
<p class="i0">And grey the faces that were gathering among the fallen ashes of the day,</p>
<p class="i0">And red the faces, yellow, flickering, under the lamps upon the long highway.</p>
<p class="i0">And some were gashed with smiles, and quaint grimaces of hate and pain and hunger and despair,</p>
<p class="i0">And some wore coloured hats and meek frivolities, limp ribbons, and false pansies in their hair,</p>
<p class="i0">But all were cold, and all seemed passionless; there shone no zest or splendour in their lives,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor hope in anything but holidays, or watching funerals, or taking wives.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
<p class="i0">I dared not think, for truth rose horrible, slapping the face with coarse uncaring hand,</p>
<p class="i0">But like them cheated into merriment, I wilfully refused to understand;</p>
<p class="i0">Turned me away from wan-eyed poverty, trod pity underfoot, oh, danced on grief,</p>
<p class="i0">Bade the crowd sing and fill my desolation, bade them be glad and hide my disbelief.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Strange we so love the world&mdash;for presently, out of my window looking on the city,</p>
<p class="i0">I blessed the night, and the roofs slumbering all huddled, and I felt no shame nor pity</p>
<p class="i0">For all our dusty days of journeying amid the wreck and ruins of our dreams,</p>
<p class="i0">Meandering in a bleared forgetfulness, where lethe laps the wharf of sleeping streams.</p>
<p class="i0">I only breathed the air, intensified by the ascending breath of million lungs,</p>
<p class="i0">And heard the labouring metropolis, quickened by whispers of a million tongues;</p>
<p class="i0">And felt a king of splendid loneliness, and felt an atom of the peopled spaces,</p>
<p class="i0">And felt again my lordly egoism, one face distinct among the blur of faces.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">A ragged</span> drummer rides along the street,</p>
<p class="i4">And at his coming</p>
<p class="i0">The silence fills with tunes and rustling feet</p>
<p class="i0">And voices humming.</p>
<p class="i0">He rode a year ago from far away,</p>
<p class="i0">On charger prancing,</p>
<p class="i0">With bright new buttons and with ribbons gay,</p>
<p class="i0">And banners dancing.</p>
<p class="i0">Oh, he was fatter than the bursting drum</p>
<p class="i0">He bore so proudly,</p>
<p class="i0">His roaring music woke the silence dumb</p>
<p class="i0">To thunder loudly.</p>
<p class="i0">And by his side the old men and the young</p>
<p class="i0">Had followed cheering</p>
<p class="i0">Into the sunset smiling as they sung,</p>
<p class="i0">Nor thought of fearing.</p>
<p class="i0">They left their lovers and their mothers' lap,</p>
<p class="i0">Their homes demolish,</p>
<p class="i0">"For, look, I have a ribbon for my cap,</p>
<p class="i0">A sword to polish!"</p>
<p class="i0">And so the town was silent once again,</p>
<p class="i0">Though tunes of battle</p>
<p class="i0">Beat fearful in the wind, or in the rain</p>
<p class="i0">Ghost drums would rattle.</p>
<p class="i0">But at the chuckling dice or careful loom,</p>
<p class="i0">Or candled churches</p>
<p class="i0">A few forgot or prayed or followed doom</p>
<p class="i0">With drunken lurches....</p>
<p class="i0">Now loom and bar and church disgorge the throng,</p>
<p class="i0">In huddled masses</p>
<p class="i0">They stand aghast to hear the drummer's song</p>
<p class="i0">As back he <span class="locked">passes&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i0">Palsied and drear and bent he turns alone</p>
<p class="i0">In rags and tatters,</p>
<p class="i0">And on a soundless barrel with a bone</p>
<p class="i0">He beats and batters.</p>
<p class="i0">"Where march your feet so gaily, careless crowd,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
<p class="i0">That we may kiss them?</p>
<p class="i0">Where sound your little songs that rang so loud</p>
<p class="i0">To us that miss them?"</p>
<p class="i0">There are no songs, no happy marching feet,</p>
<p class="i0">No favours flying:</p>
<p class="i0">The drummer passes ... on the quiet street</p>
<p class="i0">The sun is dying.</p>
<p class="i0">Sun that must bleed to death so red and brave!...</p>
<p class="i0">Have done with weeping,</p>
<p class="i0">But put your ribbons on a soldier's grave</p>
<p class="i0">As he lies sleeping.</p>

<p class="i0">Forgotten prayers rise up in resurrection,</p>

<p class="i0">In the blackest night of sleep</p>
<p class="i0">Though I be sunk a thousand fathoms</p>
<p class="i0">In the cerulean depths of slow oblivion,</p>
<p class="i0">My soul still swims toward you</p>
<p class="i0">Against the envious pressure of the tide....</p>
<p class="i0">You who are so tired, so filled with sleep</p>
<p class="i0">That you would brush a rose-leaf from your cheek</p>
<p class="i0">Lest its heaviness should stir your rest,</p>
<p class="i0">How can you shoulder the weight of my great burden</p>

<p class="i0">No moth-winged Cupid painted on the air,</p>
<p class="i0">No thin flute music petaling the silence</p>
<p class="i0">As leaves that flutter from a cherry tree.</p>
<p class="i0">It is the thought that broods upon its death,</p>
<p class="i0">The dread of mountains looking to the storm</p>
<p class="i0">Ere shrieks of lightning cleave their breasts in twain.</p>
<p class="i0">It is the fire that pillars up the stars</p>
<p class="i0">To mix its flame with their eternal gold.</p>
<p class="i0">Oh, listen to me!</p>
<p class="i0">You shall hear my message sung from sphere to sphere</p>
<p class="i0">As star-dust pouring a path through Heaven.</p>
<p class="i0">You shall know me</p>

<p class="i0">In the arrows of sunlight shot through meshing leaves</p>
<p class="i0">And quivering in the moss;</p>
<p class="i0">In the abandoned play of breakers</p>
<p class="i0">Showering their crystals to the moon;</p>
<p class="i0">In the folly of rainbow dolphins.</p>
<p class="i0">I only ask of you</p>
<p class="i0">To be the diver in my deepest pool,</p>
<p class="i0">To bring from out its blue obscurity</p>
<p class="i0">The things my life has moulded unaware,</p>
<p class="i0">Treasures my passion and my hunger fashioned</p>
<p class="i0">In loneliness of prayer unlit by life,</p>
<p class="i0">Created out of nothing save myself</p>
<p class="i0">Within the blind fast silence of the soul.</p>

<p class="i0">Beckoning to the loitering stranger,</p>
<p class="i0">The wind, to sing them his eerie ballads.</p>

<p class="i0">And the lean thief shall pass,</p>
<p class="i0">Snatching the glittering toys away from love,</p>
<p class="i0">Plucking the feathers from the wings of peace.</p>
<p class="i0">And Life herself, grown old and crooked now,</p>
<p class="i0">Shall go the way that her long shadow points,</p>
<p class="i0">Her long black shadow down the roads of sleep.</p>

<p class="i0">Like ancient frescoes painted on the wall.</p>

<p class="i0">And I can hear the call of birds and bells</p>
<p class="i0">And shadowy sound of waves, and wind through leaves</p>

<p class="i0">And far off voices whispering farewells.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I dream again the joy I used to know</p>
<p class="i0">While straying by the sea that hardly sighed</p>
<p class="i0">A sorrow in my singing, as the tide</p>
<p class="i0">Crept up to clasp me, smiled, and let me go.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And I remember all the glad lost hours,</p>

<p class="i0">The berries plucked with loitering delight,</p>
<p class="i0">Staining the dusk with purple, till the thought</p>
<p class="i0">Of starry little ghosts behind us caught</p>
<p class="i0">Our hearts and made us fearful of the night.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The London evenings huddled in the rain</p>
<p class="i0">Whose misty prisms shone with lamplight pale,</p>
<p class="i0">Making our hearts seem sinister and frail,</p>
<p class="i0">Fainting our thoughts with mystery and pain.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I have a world of memories to dream,</p>
<p class="i0">To touch with loving fingers as a sigh</p>
<p class="i0">Revives a little flame and lets it die.</p>

<p class="i0">Now that they look so peaceful lying dead?</p>

<p class="i0">The broken trophies of the things she gave</p>
<p class="i0">And took away to give us dreams instead?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The things we love and lose before we find</p>

<p class="i0">That now are only music of the wind.</p>
